### Tesoro (TSX)

Tesoro (TSX) is a decentralized cryptocurrency based on PoW consensus that uses RandomX
algorithm which favours CPU powered PCs over GPUs allowing average users to be a part of the
creation and maintenance of its blockchain and network and also using modified Monero source
code in Tesoro grants compatibility along with high security and privacy features.

Tesoro Project was initiated by a group of independent of developers spread out through many
different countries to develop the Tesoro (TSX) cryptocurrency.

### Purpose and Use-case of Tesoro (TSX)

Blockfinex is a cryptocurrency trading and exchange platform built upon a lightning fast execution
engine. For the ease of its users to use trading fee discounts, community rewards, community
incentives, online payments etc. a native currency was proposed to be used within the exchange as
well as to be utilized as a measure of online payments outside the exchange.

Unlike a token issued using smart contracts where a handful of people take control of the supply,
developers behind Blockfinex exchange decided to develop Tesoro (TSX) as its native
cryptocurrency since its integral properties help users themselves participate in nurturing the
blockchain thus bringing decentralization and fair distribution of supply to its network.
